## Files in The Repo

This repository contains **all** datasets used in analysis, in CSV format.

Additionally, each person's individual notebook (containing just their work) is present. 

- Owen Capell's work: owen_analysis.ipynb
- Ibrahim Miloua's word: Ibrahim's_part_final.ipynb
- HarryRittenhoueFinal.ipynb

Finally, **our combined notebook is CombinedNotebook.ipynb**. We found it practical to use this combined notebook to essentially group all our work from the individual notebooks (with individual conclusions) and then add our final conclusion based on the combination of all our data.
